Management	Activities
Pre-sowing*
Nutrients	• Turmeric crop requires clean cultivation and fi ne tilth.
• Turmeric needs very heavy manuring during the four months period after planting. Crop requires 120 Kg N, 50 Kg P2O5 and 80 Kg K 2O per acre in organic and inorganic forms.
• The NPK requirement has to be applied in two or three splits. The first dose of N has to be applied before planting through inorganic sources.
• Use 10 t/ acre Farmyard manure or 4 t / acre vermicompost at the time of field preparation.
• Apply castor or neem cake @ 200 Kg/ acre.
• Incorporate manure / compost in soil at 2 -3 weeks before planting.
• Use coir compost @ 1 t/acre combined with FYM, biofertilizers (Azospirillum).
• Use leguminous green manure crops like pigeon pea, black gram, cowpea, cluster bean and French bean and incorporate in soil before planting.
Weeds	• Deep summer ploughing and solarisation during summer reduces weed infestation, soil borne diseases, nematodes, etc.
• Use raised beds (30 cm with 1 meter width).
• At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize weeds menace in field.
Pests, nematode, soil borne pathogens and other diseases	Cultural control:
• Deep summer ploughing during summer.
• Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests.
Biological control:
• At the time of planting, apply 25 g powdered neem cake and mix well with the soil in each pit taken at a spacing of 20-25 cm within and between rows or application of neem cake @ 2 t/ acre is also desirable.
Rhizome rot/ soft rot	Cultural control:
• Use of resistant varieties to rhizome wilt/ rot.
• Crop rotation with maize, cotton, soybean.
• Planting of disease-free seed rhizomes.
• Use raised beds of 30 cm height.
• Flooding treatment for 30 days, soil solarisation during hottest months for 60 days
• Treat the rhizomes with hot water at 51° C for 10 minutes.
• Rhizomes treatment can be done by keeping them under clear polythene sheet under direct sunlight for raising the temperature 48o C and this temperature is retained for 30 minutes.
• Use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses.
• Use raised beds of 15-30 cm height, 1 m width and of convenient length may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing between beds.
Biological control:
• Planting of perennial / seasonal flowering plants like basil, marigold, fennel, sunflower etc. along the border to attract and enhance the population of biocontrol agents for managing pests/disease.
• Application of pine needle and neem cake powder treatments @ 100 Kg/ acre (in two splits)
• Application of oil cakes made from Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum inophyllum, Pongamia glabra, Hibiscus sabdariffa and Brassica campestris @ 0.8 tonnes/ acre
Bacterial wilt**	Cultural control:

• Planting of disease-free seed rhizomes.
• Use crop rotation with non-host crops like ragi, paddy, maize, sorghum etc.
• Avoid crop rotation with tomato, potato, chillies, brinjal and peanut, as these plants are hosts for the wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.
• Rhizome treatment with hot water 47oC for 3 minutes.
• Use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses.
• Avoid over irrigation, and flood irrigation in disease affected areas.
• It is sensitive to high pH (alkaline soils).
Planting/ seedling stage*
Nutrients	• The NPK requirement has to be applied in two or three splits. The first dose of N has to be applied before planting through inorganic sources.
