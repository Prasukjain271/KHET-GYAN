Management	Activity
Pre – sowing*
Nutrients	Soil test based nutrient recommendations should be followed also,
• Apply organic manures @ 8 to 10 tonnes/acre treated with Trichoderma.
• Press mud can also be used as organic manure @ 2 tonnes/acre which is particularly useful in saline alkali soils.
• Sugarcane trash can be used as a mulch. Spray trash with 32 Kg urea, 40 Kg Single Super Phosphate and 4 Kg decomposing culture/acre for better decomposition.
• Sugarcane trash can also be incorporated while making organic manure along with press mud and use of earthworms for preparing vermicompost.
• Crops like sun hemp and dhaincha are grown as green manure crop. Green manure crops can be grown as a sole crop and buried in the field at an age of 1.5 to 2 months (before flowering).
Weeds	Cultural control:
• Deep ploughing in summer and left undisturbed 20-25 days.
• Cross ploughing of land followed by clod crushing and 1-2 harrowing.
• At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique ie. pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field.
Sowing*
Nutrients	• Use biofertilizers such as Acetobactor, Azotobactor, Azospirillium, Bacillus or Pseudomonas. Either of these biofertilizers or in combination should be used at the time of sowing @ 5 Kg / acre for sett treatment or in soil along with FYM.
• Basal application of NPK is done on soil test basis.
•  In sugarcane, fertilizer should be applied as per the table mentioned below.
• Apply zinc sulphate @10 Kg/acre in soil at the time of planting.
• In soils deficient with micro nutrients like iron, zinc, manganese, copper, molybdenum and boron, 10 Kg ferrous sulphate, 8 Kg zinc sulphate, 4 Kg manganese sulphate, 4 Kg copper sulphate,1 Kg, sodium molybdate and 2 Kg borax per hectare should be applied.
• Micro nutrient fertilizers should be mixed with well decomposed dung manure or compost and applied as basal dose.
